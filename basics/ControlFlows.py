'''
every Python tool that scans an object from left to right uses the iteration protocol.

'''


#for LOOP_VARIABLE in SEQUENCE:
#    STATEMENTS

for friend in ['Shreya', 'Anshi']:
    invitation = "Hi " + friend + ".  Please come to my party on Saturday!"
    print(invitation)

# printing table
for x in range(13):   # Generate numbers 0 to 12
    print(x, '\t', 2**x)

#e.g. 
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words:
	print(w, len(w))

for c in 'spam':
	print(c.upper())

## Another while loop example
x = 4
print('before while loop')
while x > 0:
	print('spam!' * x)
	x -= 1
print('after while loop')


##
# The list comprehension will often run faster than a for loop today on some types of code (perhaps even twice as fast)
# â€”a property that could matter in your programs for large data sets.


squares = []
for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: # This is what a list comprehension does
	squares.append(x ** 2) # Both run the iteration protocol internally
print('squares (approach-1) :', squares);

''' This is equivalent to below code '''
squares = []
squares = [x ** 2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]
print('squares (approach-2) :', squares);


## BREAK
for i in [12, 16, 17, 24, 29]:
    if i % 2 == 1:  # if the number is odd
        break       # immediately exit the loop
    print(i)
print("done")

#CONTINUE
for i in [12, 16, 17, 24, 29, 30]:
    if i % 2 == 1:      # if the number is odd
        continue        # don't process it
    print(i)
print("done")

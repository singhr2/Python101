In standard Python (a.k.a. CPython), the space is reclaimed immediately, as soon as the last reference to an object is removed.
garbage collection cleans up unused memory as your program runs
In Python, when we lose the last reference to the object—by assigning its variable to something else, for example
—all of the memory space occupied by that object’s structure is automatically cleaned up for us:
>>> rec = 0 # Now the object's space is reclaimed

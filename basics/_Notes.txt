import os
os.system('cls')

In 3.X, raw_input was renamed input, and 
print is a built-in function instead of a statement


time and timeit modules for timing the speed of alternatives, and
the profile module for isolating bottlenecks.

Python’s toolset is layered:
GENERIC OPERATIONS that span multiple types show up as built-in functions or expressions (e.g.,len(X), X[0]),
but TYPE-SPECIFIC OPERATIONS are method calls (e.g., aString.upper()).

In standard Python (a.k.a. CPython), the space is reclaimed immediately, as soon as the last reference to an object is removed.
garbage collection cleans up unused memory as your program runs
In Python, when we lose the last reference to the object—by assigning its variable to something else, for example
—all of the memory space occupied by that object’s structure is automatically cleaned up for us:
>>> rec = 0 # Now the object's space is reclaimed


if you need to do serious number crunching, an optional extension for Python called NumPy (Numeric Python)
provides advanced numeric programming tools, such as a matrix data type, vector processing, and sophisticated computation libraries.
Hardcore scientific programming groups at places like Los Alamos and NASA use Python with NumPy
to implement the sorts of tasks they previously coded in C++, FORTRAN, or Matlab.
NumPy is currently an optional extension; it doesn’t come with Python and must be installed separately

HTML5 has a new attribute, charset, which makes it easier to define charset:
HTML 4.01: <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
HTML5: <meta charset="UTF-8">

A Unicode encoding such as UTF-8 is a good choice for a number of reasons.

ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set also supported 256 different character codes.
The default character-set in HTML5 is UTF-8.
UTF-8 (Unicode) covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.

A Content-Type tells the web browser or email application how to interpret the text characters in your HTML or the body of the email.

HTML Encoding is a way of ensuring text will be accurately shown by a browser.
Wikipedia is a great case study for an application that originally used ISO-8859-1 but switched to UTF-8 when it became far to cumbersome to support foreign languages.
ServletResponse.setContentType ("text/html;charset=utf-8");

The process of ‘HTML encoding’ involves replacing certain characters (such as < and >) with a particular ‘escape sequence’ of characters that a browser knows how to display and that don’ interfere with browser rendering.


There are two types of form submission: application/x-www-form-urlencoded which is used for GET and by default for POST, and multipart/form-data which may be used by POST, and is required when you want to upload files.

application/x-www-form-urlencoded


This is the Content-Type that GET requests must use, and POST requests use by default.

multipart/form-data
Multipart form submission takes away a lot of the ambiguity that percent-encoding had

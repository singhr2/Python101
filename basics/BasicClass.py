'''
In abstract terms, classes define new types of objects that extend the core set.
Classes are an optional feature of Python, and simpler built-in types such as lists and dictionaries are often better tools than user-coded classes.
'''

# The function called __init__ is run when we create an instance of class
# self is the first parameter in any function defined inside a class.
# classâ€™s methods automatically receive the instance being processed by a given method call (in the self argument)

# e.g., 1

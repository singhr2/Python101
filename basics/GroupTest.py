#Beside strings and numbers, Python provides four other important basic types:
# tuples
#       sequence of values,
#       each one accessible individually
#       surrounded by parentheses,

# lists,
# sets,
# dictionaries.

print("I could have code like this.")  # and the comment after is ignored

#When you write a program, or read someone else's program, it is important to pay attention to the type of enclosing braces when you see groupings of elements.
# The differences among {}, [], and () are important.

print("A %s %s %s %s" % ("string", "filled", "by a", "tuple"))

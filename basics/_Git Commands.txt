If you are lazy and don't want to run vim to edit the file you can run the following command:
It will prepend :path_to_ignore to the existing .gitignore content.
    echo ":path_to_ignore" >> .gitignore

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:
        basics/SampleTextFile.txt
Please move or remove them before you merge.

'''
classes are essentially factories for generating multiple instances

A class consists of two parts: the header and the body. 

Pythonâ€™s class model is extremely dynamic. 
Classes and instances are just namespace objects, with attributes created on the fly by assignment.

The instances possess dictionaries __dict__, which they use to store their attributes and their corresponding values.

Python automatically calls a method named __init__ each time an instance is generated from a class
The new instance is passed in to the self argument of __init__ as usual
! The __init__ method is known as the constructor because of when it is run
If no __init__ is present, class calls return an empty instance, without initializing it.

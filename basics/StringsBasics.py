In Python, if youâ€™d like a statement to continue to the next line, it is
possible to use the \ marker to indicate this:
'''
x = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \
    5 + 6 + 7 + 8
print('x:', x)
print('type(x) :', type(x))

# Semicolon Can Optionally Terminate a Statement
# generally discouraged by most Python style guides,
str_2 = 'String 2'; str_3 = "3rd string"
print('str_2 :', str_2, ', str_3 :', str_3)

#StarredName.py

'''
single starred name, *X, can be used in the assignment target
in order to specify a more general matching against the sequenceâ€”
the starred name is assigned a list,
which collects all items in the sequence not assigned to other names.

More generally, wherever the starred name shows up,
it will be assigned a list that collects every unassigned name at that position:

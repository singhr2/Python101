# ClassDecorators.py

'''
<!> Functions and methods are called callable as they can be called.
In fact, any object which implements the special method __call__() is termed callable. 
So, in the most basic sense, a decorator is a callable that returns a callable.

The @ indicates the application of the decorator.

A decorator takes in a function, adds some functionality and returns it.
In the context of design patterns, decorators dynamically alter the functionality of a function, method or class 
without having to directly use subclasses.

Python decorators : 
* similar to the notion and syntax of annotations in Java 
* both addressed this specific need and provided a general tool for adding logic that manages both functions and classes, or later calls to them.

It comes in two flavors:
>>> Function decorators (Python 2.4) : augment 'function' definitions. 
 They specify special operation modes for both simple functions and classesâ€™ methods 
 by wrapping them in an extra layer of logic implemented as another function, usually called a metafunction.
 
 Function decorators are simply wrappers to existing functions.

 For instance, they may be used to augment functions with code that logs calls made to them, 
 checks the types of passed arguments during debugging, and so on.
 
 built-in function decorators : marking static and class methods


 SYNTAX:
  @<metafunction>
  def <someFunction- a function that manages anotherfunction>:
 	logic


>>> Class decorators (added in Python 2.6 and 3.0) : augment 'class' definitions. 
  They do the same for classes, adding support for management of whole objects and their interfaces. 
  Though perhaps simpler, they often overlap in roles with metaclasses.

'''
Notice that the constructor for my_decorator is executed at the point of decoration of the function. 
Since we can call f() inside __init__(), it shows that the creation of f() is complete before the decorator is called. 

Output:
	inside my_decorator.__init__()
	inside aFunction()
	Finished decorating aFunction()
	inside my_decorator.__call__()

#Future.py

'''
A future statement is a directive to the compiler 
that a particular module should be compiled 
using syntax or semantics that will be available in a specified future release of Python where the feature becomes standard.

The future statement is intended to ease migration to future versions of Python 
that introduce incompatible changes to the language. 
It allows use of the new features on a per-module basis before the release in which the feature becomes standard.

Syntax:
from __future__ import featurename  # must appear as the first executable statement in the file
